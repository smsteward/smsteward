# Hi, Iâ€™m @smsteward
## About Me:
   - I'm currently working as a Scientific Data Analyst for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
   - I am a proud GNU/Linux user running Arch Linux as my daily driver.
   - I do most of my professional work in Python, but also have extensive experience in MATLAB/Octave, Mathematica,
       and LaTeX, and some minor experience with Magma, C/C++, PARI/GP, and shell scripting.

## Purpose:
   - The purpose of this repository is to hold a variety of my personal projects, including some miscellaneous Python programs, 
     shell scripts for automating the install of various Desktop Environments (DEs) for Arch Linux or compatible
     Arch Linux derivatives, and other things I find interesting at the time and want to keep track of.
   - I'll do my best to keep the various repos separate, but no guarantees.

## License:
   - All of my code is licensed under the GNU Affero GPL. Should you wish to clone one of my repos and use my scripts,
     you are free to do so (at your own risk) and modify the code to your liking. If you desire to publish your own changes,
     you must also use the GNU Affero GPL.
