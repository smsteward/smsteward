# Hi, Iâ€™m @smsteward
## About Me:
   - I'm currently working as a Scientific Data Analyst for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
   - I am a proud GNU/Linux user running Arch Linux as my daily driver.
   - I do most of my professional work in Python, but also have extensive experience in MATLAB/Octave, Mathematica,
       and LaTeX, and some minor experience with Magma, C/C++, PARI/GP, and shell scripting.

## Purpose:
   - The purpose of this repository is to hold a variety of my personal projects, including some miscellaneous Python programs, 
     shell scripts for automating the install of various Desktop Environments (DEs) for Arch Linux or compatible
     Arch Linux derivatives, and other things I find interesting at the time and want to keep track of.
   - I'll do my best to keep the various repos separate, but no guarantees.

## License:
   - Most of my Pacman scripts are/will be licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, since they are designed to be run on a server or headless system in order to automate the process of installing a desktop environment. All of my other projects, including Arch Linux AUR packages, are/will be generally released under the same license as the program itself (MIT, GPL, etc). Check the LICENSE file in each repository for more information.
